# Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Categorizing Car Insurance Claims: A Predictive Analysis Study (Data Mining Project)


# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for car insurance claims by analysing a comprehensive dataset of policyholder information. Insurance companies must correctly forecast the possibility that policyholders will file claims in order to efficiently manage their resources and procedures given the growing complexity of insurance risk assessment. We frame the problem as a Classification task, aiming to predict whether a policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not. To ensure the robustness in our results, several evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and techniques like cross-validation will be used. The dataset chosen for this task is “Car Insurance Claim” from Kaggle repositories.

# Tools and Languages Used
Language: Python
Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Colab
Packages Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost

## Results
After extensive and exhaustive search for the best models using various classifiers and different tuning approaches. We have reached the conclusion that for the given data, the models begin to stabilize and reach an Accuracy of 93.39%.
This accuracy is achieved by Logistic Regression, Multi-layer perceptron Neural Network Classifier, and Light GBM Classifier
